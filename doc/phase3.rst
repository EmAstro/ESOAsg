=======================
The ESO Phase 3 Process
=======================

The so-called `Phase 3 <https://www.eso.org/sci/observing/phase3.html>`_ is the process of preparation, validation and ingestion of science data product (`SDP`) for storage in the ESO science archive facility, and subsequent data pubblication to the science community.
These `SDPs` are data products with instrument and atmospheric signatures removed, calibrated in physical units, and with noise properties quantified and documented.

To ensure the successful integration of `SDPs` into the archive, ESO supports the users in carrying out the Phase 3 process by defining `ESO/SDP data  standards <https://www.eso.org/sci/observing/phase3/p3sdpstd.pdf>`_, by devising procedures and providing the infrastructure for the delivery of the `SDPs`, and by supplying tools for the data preparation.
