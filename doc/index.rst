Welcome to ESOAsg's documentation!
==================================

ESOAsg is a (work in progress) package created to help users to make data ESO phase3 compliant and to provide an easy access to the `ESO archive <http://archive.eso.org/cms.html>`_. This code is free software and distributed in the hope that will be useful, but **without** **any** **warranty**. Data providers and data users are always the final resposible for validation and collection of the data.
