Archive Catalogues
==================

Overview
========

The ESO catalogue facility provides access to the collection of data that were produced by PIs of ESO programmes and then integrated into the ESO science archive through the Phase 3 process.
The full list of available catalogue could be found `here<https://www.eso.org/qi/>`_.

To access the data you can use the `programmatic access<http://archive.eso.org/programmatic/#TAP>`_ via the `tap_cat` TAP Service. 
The module `archive_catalogues` provides some simple `python` wrapper around this. 

Please, when you use data from the archive, follow the :doc:`datapolicy`
